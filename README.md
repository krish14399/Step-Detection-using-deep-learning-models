# Step-Detection-using-deep-learning-models
Developed to accurately identify start and end steps in sequential data.    Tested GRU, LSTM, and CNN; LSTM performed best due to its ability to capture long-term dependencies.    Achieved high precision using an LSTM model with optimized data labeling and tuning.
